# ComplyCo - Sample Applications

The purpose of this project is to showcase solutions and best practices on how to implement ComplyCo's private SDK [**ComplySDK**].

This repository is also responsible for hosting the SDK packages in GitHub Packages, for the Maven repository to leverage as needed.

## Implementation Guide

For a guide on how to implement the **ComplySDK** into your own application, please see [this document](https://www.notion.so/complyco/Android-SDK-Documentation-2536c4baab1c8044918ae0965d77c82d?source=copy_link) for a step-by-step guide on how to do so.

_**NOTE**: If the link to the step-by-step guide doc does not work, please ask for access!_

Alternative, check out the [Sample Apps](#sample-apps) inside this project for a functional example on how to integrate the **ComplySDK** packages into your own application.
